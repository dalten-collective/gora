# gora
A Proof of Attendance Token for Urbit

## How to install:
You can choose to install a version of %gora that uses a Vue based front end here:

web+urbitgraph://~laddys-dozzod-dalten/gora

or a version with a `sail` based front end here:

web+urbitgraph://~mister-dozzod-dalten/gora

Please note that at this time there is an issue with installing the `sail` version first. If you do so, you will not be able to switch. If you install the Vue version first, you should be able to switch to sail, but you will then be stuck in sail until we resolve the underlying issue with the eyre binding.

The current version does not support many user actions through the front end - please see the Projects section of this repo for information on our development pipeline and upcoming features.

Thank you for visiting!
